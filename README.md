# Documentation

Welcome to CollAction Documentation!

CollAction is a non-profit organization that set out to help solve collective action problems, and we do so by bringing like-minded people together and make it easy for people to contribute towards certain goals.

We value any and all contributions, and we do our best to keep our documentation up to date, share knowledge, and help everyone in our community.



If anything is missing, feel free to reach out to us, or file a suggestion for an improvement to our documentation here: \<TBD>
