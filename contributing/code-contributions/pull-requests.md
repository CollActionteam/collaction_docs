# Pull Requests

When your feature/fix is ready for review, you can open a pull request to the `development` branch. We never allow PRs directly to our release branch `main`.

Remember to add a reference to the related Github Issue, this can be done by writing `#` followed by the Issue ID. You can use keywords such as `Closes: #123` if your PR closes the issue, or `Relates: #123` if it is only a partial solution.

When you are done preparing your PR, please do not tag/mention any of the team members for a review, we look at all PRs in our own time, and we do our best to give constructive feedback and help all authors until their PR is done.

Sometimes a PR might be disregarded or closed, we do our best to inform you why, if you still have questions feel free to reach out to us, and we can give a more in-depth explanation.
