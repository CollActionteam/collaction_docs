# Bug Report

Found a bug or something that is not aligned with design or expectations, maybe something looks weird and is a generally bad User Experience? Then file an issue/bug report.

When filing a bug report, you can do it on Github for the relevant project, on the `issues` tab. See below a list of links depending on what project, if you are unsure what project your feature request pertains to, then use the first link:

* [CollAction Mobile Application](https://github.com/CollActionteam/collaction\_app/issues)
* [CollAction Backend](https://github.com/CollActionteam/collaction\_api/issues)
* [CollAction Admin CMS](https://github.com/CollActionteam/collaction\_cms/issues)
* [CollAction CLI](https://github.com/CollActionteam/collaction\_cli/issues)
* [CollAction Website](https://github.com/CollActionteam/collaction\_website/issues)
* [CollAction Design](https://github.com/CollActionteam/collaction\_design/issues)

Simply hit `New issue`, select the `Bug Report` template, and fill in all of the details of your bug. Remember to fill in all information, as it might be relevant for any developer who might want to replicate the issue, or fix it.

If you somehow have a hard time finding the information requested in the template, we will do our best to help you after you have created the issue. Keep in mind, the most important thing when filing an issue, **is the steps on how to reproduce the bug!**
