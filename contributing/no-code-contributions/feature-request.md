# Feature Request

If you have a good idea for an improvement or a feature you would like to see in one of our applications, then you have come to the right page.

When filing a feature request, you can do it on Github for the relevant project, on the `issues` tab. See below a list for links depending on what project, if you are unsure what project your feature request pertains to, then use the first link:

* [CollAction Mobile Application](https://github.com/CollActionteam/collaction\_app/issues)
* [CollAction Backend](https://github.com/CollActionteam/collaction\_api/issues)
* [CollAction Admin CMS](https://github.com/CollActionteam/collaction\_cms/issues)
* [CollAction CLI](https://github.com/CollActionteam/collaction\_cli/issues)
* [CollAction Website](https://github.com/CollActionteam/collaction\_website/issues)
* [CollAction Design](https://github.com/CollActionteam/collaction\_design/issues)

Simply hit `New issue`, select the `Feature Request` template, and fill in all of the details of your idea.

It is always a good idea, to perform a search with some keywords from your feature request before you actually create it. Someone might have already suggested the same feature or one which is relevant. Adding your ideas to an existing similar feature request might make it more valuable.
